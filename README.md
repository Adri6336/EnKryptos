# EnKryptos
Application for encrypting and decrypting files with the AES encryption protocol.

# Using Enkryptos

This application is meant to be used as an executable. If you'd prefer to use it as a script, you'll 
first need to fill in the "[REDACTED]" password with a long random key.

As an executable, all you'll need to get started is the zip file included in this repository. Download it, 
extract it, and run the .exe file within. Don't move the executable -- it's got a lot of necessary parts
hidden within the folder (makes it easier to find the right file).
