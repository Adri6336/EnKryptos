Encrypting and Decrypting Files:

	To get started with encrypting files, simply run the EnKryptos exe file and press the big "Encrypt a File" button to the left of the application. You can encrypt virtually any file that hasn't already been encrypted by EnKryptos. You'll find the files you've encrypted within the encrypted_files folder (created once you first encrypt a file)

	Decrypting files follows most of the same process (except you press "Decrypt a File"), but you'll need to have the correct key inserted. When you first run EnKryptos, a new random key is generated for you (located in the key folder). This key is required to decrypt any file encrypted while the key was inserted. If you download another version of EnKryptos and want to decrypt files you made before, you'll need to replace the key generated for you with the key you used previously. If you somehow lose this key, your files will be forever encrypted (make sure not to lose this key). Any file you decrypt will be located in the newly generated decrypted_files folder.

Creating and Reading Encrypted Messages:

	EnKryptos allows you to create ultra-secure messages. To create a message, you'll need to first fill in some info into the text boxes found to the right of the application. The text boxes contain some pre-filled text to help you understand its purpose -- replace this text with your own. The topmost text box allows you to customize the name of the message (this will not be encrypted, but will serve as the file name); the text box below it allows you to customize the message's contents (this will be encrypted). As with decrypting files, only individuals with the correct key inserted will be able to read your messages. You can find the messages you create in the encrypted_files folder.

	To read a message you've recieved, insert the correct key then decrypt using the "Decrypt a File" button to the left of the application. The contents of the message, if successfully decrypted, will be displayed in the text box towards the bottom of the application. EnKryptos messages will only be readable from this text box; no decrypted message will be created for future reading outside of EnKryptos. In order to re-read recieved messages, you'll need to repeat the decryption process.
